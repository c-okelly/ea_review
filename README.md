# ea_review

This demo was built using a Jhipster generator. This create the vast majoirty of the scaffolding code for the project.

## Building a demo version of the projects

```bash
cd games_review_site
./gradlew
```
This uses the packages Gradle binary to comiple and launch a demo version of the site

There is also a production option provided by default. This can be used to create a fat-jar that could then we wrapped in a docker image for deployability. 

### Production Build

```bash
cd games_review_site
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```


## Testing the project

The project comes with a large number of tests. These can be run as follows.

```bash
cd games_review_site
./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
```

## Project data model

The image below show the data model that was used for the project. We hace Review entity and the Coment entity. These have a one to many relationship as a single review will have many comments but each comment is only assocaited with a single review.

## Project setup and layout

### Database

The project uses an inmemory H2 database. This would have no data persistance between JVM restarts but allows a development version to be worked on. In future the database would probalby decoupled from the application. An alternative would be to ensure data is written to disk.

If the app was to be packaged in a docker container in future we would need to ensure some type of data persitance occured. 

### Domain models

There are a number of domain models packaged as part of the application generation. These include the following Authority / PersistentAuditEvent / User. 

Apart from these I have explicty created a Comment and Review model. These also have an associated repository interface crated. This allows use to use Hibernate to persist the data into our associated database.

### Controllers 

Each of the generated domain models also have all of their basic CRUD operations generated by default. These have associated test with them as well. 

As the business use cases expands and the requirements become more clear this would be refined to seperated out the application and the businss logic.
